Built with vanilla JS. This web app allows a user to assign a task to a priority list. If the user finishes a task they can click on the complete tick, if the task is no longer required the user can click on the minus sign. Each task shows a countdown, when it gets to zero the task is automatically removed from the list. The colour of the task represents the priority level. Tasks are eventually assigned a status of either unfinished or complete. The state of the data is maintained by using the browser's internal database system Indexeddb.
