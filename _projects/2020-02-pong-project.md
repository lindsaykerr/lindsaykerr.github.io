After leaving university, I needed to consolidate the knowledge I had acquired. I chose Pong as a project to do so. I used Java as it was the language I became familiar with during my studies. The resulting implementation was a bit crude as I had never investigated topics such as object collision detection or the correct math to use. Yet, the end albeit unfinished result, still performed well and fulfilled the intended aim of the project.
