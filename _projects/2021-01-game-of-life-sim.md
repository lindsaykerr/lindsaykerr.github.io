This project started as a programming exercise for implementing Conway’s game of life. The first implementation ran in the command terminal. I felt that this was cumbersome, especially when I needed to adjust the simulation parameters. This urge to improve the user experience pushed me to explore Python’s default GUI system, Tkinter.
