I am a software developer based in Scotland who has been coding off and on personal projects for the past 15 years. It has only been in the last two (time of writing, 2022), after I achieved a BSc in the field, that I have directed most of my attention towards the art of coding. Before this, I was an avid artist. I enjoy coding for the very same reasons I enjoy creating art, the creative process, using one's imagination and the fun of coming up with solutions.   

This dev space is all about me tinkering, testing and considering code. Hopefully with a bit of art mixed in. I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kerr_linz).
