      <p>The idea for this post originated from a question asked on Reddit the other day, one that is often asked, ‘I have learned languages A, B and C should I learn D?’. The person in question had learnt several languages over the past few months and wanted to know if learning this new language would prove beneficial because it was popular. It had occurred to me that their approach to learning languages had missed the mark. It was something which I also failed to grasp early on in my development journey. If I had, I would not have wasted so much valuable time with little to show. They had failed to realise that learning a given language is only a prerequisite to reaching a professional role. Thus, choosing to learn another language based on its popularity can often be viewed as an exercise in wasting time.</p>

      <p>I considered this question a while back after going through a period of refamiliarising with JS (JavaScript). Coding in JS is nothing new to me, but considering what I know now would I advise someone who wants to begin their coding journey to start with JavaScript. I know when thinking back on my first encounter with JS, which was well over 10 years ago, was like fumbling about in a dark room while looking for a light switch. I had very little understanding of JavaScript’s nature, and how it was different from many other languages. I feel that this lack of understanding is all too common for JS beginners. It is likely one of the main reasons behind the love/hate sentiment that JS receives from the wider coding community. Back then I got by with writing small bits of functionality and relying on frameworks like jQuery, but I never took to the language I even had a strong disdain for it. Now I am a little wiser, older and I enjoy coding with it. I believe that for a person to really “get” this language they must first grasp certain core concepts. When they do, JS becomes enjoyable.</p>

<p>Hundreds, maybe even thousands of programming languages have existed since the days of the first computers. Some languages have lasted the test of time, while others have been snuffed out soon after their conception. This made me ponder the question, “Why do languages such as Fortran which is now over 60 years old seem to survive the test of time, while newer more capable languages seem to fade into obscurity?”.</p>
